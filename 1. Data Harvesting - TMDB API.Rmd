# Data Collection Process

The starting point of our analysis is the collection of film-related data using the [TMDB (The Movie Database)](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API. TMDB provides comprehensive [documentation](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started) that explains how to use the API to access detailed information about films. Although the most straightforward method to obtain this data would be to request all the available pages, this approach has a [significant limitation](https://www.themoviedb.org/talk/621b62abd18572001df182ea): the API allows access only to the first 500 pages, each containing 20 films, for a total of 10,000 films.

However, our primary objective is to collect data for all the films available in the TMDB database without being restricted by this predefined limit. To overcome this constraint, we adopted a different approach, leveraging the unique numeric ID assigned to each film. In TMDB, each film is identified by an integer starting from 1, which increases progressively for every new film added. Our method, therefore, involves iteratively searching for films starting from ID 1, then ID 2, ID 3, and so on.

The search process continues until a specified number of consecutive unsuccessful attempts is reached, which we set to 10,000. This stopping criterion was introduced to ensure operational efficiency, as a large number of consecutive IDs not associated with any films indicates that we have effectively reached the end of the database. This approach allowed us to achieve a broader and more comprehensive coverage of the films available on TMDB.

Below is the code used to implement this data collection:

# Execution Time and Data Volume

The execution of this code requires a considerable amount of time. In our case, the process was initiated on July 4, 2024, and took approximately 11 days to complete. During this period, the code successfully collected data on around 1 million films. Naturally, as time progresses, the number of films available on the platform will continue to grow, which will consequently increase the execution time required for future data collection.
